First we need to look at the band in which the producer was of in 1992, after looking at his wikipedia page we see that the band is called P-model.

After some more searching we see that the band only released one album in 1992 so what I did is searched every single song of this album on youtube followed by the previous chall's artist name which is x0o0x_

We then quickly find this song covered by x0o0x_ and another artist called Chogakusei.
