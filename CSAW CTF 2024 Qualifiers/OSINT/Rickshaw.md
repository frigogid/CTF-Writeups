For this challenge we need to find the phone number of the owner of this vehicule.
After looking on google for the first 4 characters of this pressure plate we realise this rickshaw is owned by the US ambassy in India

https://www.licenseplatemania.com/landenpaginas/indie.htm

We can then type on google "pink rickshaw US ambassy India" and we find in the first results this facebook post of the US Indian ambassy:
https://www.facebook.com/India.usembassy/videos/the-auto-gang-of-the-us-embassy/839571310398639/

We then go on the facebook profile of the ambassy and we can find their phone number.
